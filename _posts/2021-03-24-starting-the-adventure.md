In the midst of a global pandemic caused by the SARS-COV2 coronavirus; I decided to start blogging. I wanted to blog since a long time, I have always enjoyed writing, but many unknowns and having "no time" for it prevented me from taking it up. Things like: "I don't really know my target audience", "what would my topic or topics be?", "I don't think I am a world-class expert in anything", and many more kept stopping me from setting up my own blog. Now seemed like a good time as any so with those any tons of other questions in my head I decided it was time to start.

Funnily, this is not my first post. The birth of the blog came very natural as a way to "document" my newly established pursuit for getting myself into Machine Learning. This new adventure of mine comprises several things, and if I want to succeed I need to be serious about them all:
- I want to start coding again! I used to code a long time ago, starting when I was 8 years old in a Tandy Color Computer hooked up to my parent's TV.
- Machine Learning is a vast, wide subject, I want to learn the generals, but also to select a few areas to focus on. For now, I think I will start with:
-- Neural Networks fundamentals: history, basic architecture and math behind them
-- Deep Neural Networks
-- Reinforcement Learning
-- Current state of the art: what is at the cutting edge now in terms of Deep Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning?
  
I selected the above areas to focus on based on my personal interests, I have been fascinated by the developments in reinforcement learning for a long time, in particular [Deep Mind's](https://deepmind.com/blog) awesome [Go](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/innovations-alphago), [Chess](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go) and [Starcraft](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning) playing agents. Therefore, I started reading a lot about it and even started a personal project for coding a [tic-tac-toe learning agent](https://amaynez.github.io/deep-q-learning-tic-tac-toe/).

With my limited knowledge I have drafted the following learning path:

1. Youtube: [Three Blue One Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) videos on [Neural Networks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi), [Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) and [Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). I cannot recommend them enough, they are of sufficient depth and use animation superbly to facilitate the understanding of the subjects.
2. Coursera: [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
3. Book: [Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617294438/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_AV4DHT7CVE95D1SR2JJ8)
4. Book: [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262193981/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_10B6J4MDB7QE3YHBQF4X)

As for practical work I decided to start by [coding my first models from scratch](https://amaynez.github.io/ML-Library-from-scratch/) (without using libraries such as Tensorflow), to be able to deeply understand the math and logic behind the models, so far it has proven to be priceless.

For my next project I think I will start to do the basic hand-written digits recognition, which is the Machine Learning Hello World, for this I think I will start to use Tensorflow already.

I will continue to write about my learning road, what I find interesting and relevant, and to document all my practical exercises, as well as news and the state of the art in the world of AI.

Thanks for reading!
